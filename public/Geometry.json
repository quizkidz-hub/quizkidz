      "explanation": "The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°. Therefore, 70° + 50° + x° = 180°. Solving for x, we get x = 60°. However, one of the angles is labeled incorrectly. Since the sum of the two visible angles is already 120°, the third angle (x) must be 180° - 120° = 60°."

      "explanation": "We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (shorter sides). In this case, 6² + 8² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. Solving for c, we get c² = 36 + 64 = 100. Taking the square root of both sides gives us c = 10 cm."

      "explanation": "The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius. In this case, r = 4 cm, so the volume is (4/3)π * 4³ = (4/3) * 64π = 64π / 3 ≈ 21.33π. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 16π cm³."

      "explanation": "In a parallelogram, the area is equal to the base multiplied by the height. In this case, we can use any of the sides as the base and its corresponding height. Since the diagonal is not a side of the parallelogram, we can't use it directly. However, we can see that the diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has a base of 7 cm (half the base of the parallelogram) and a height of 10 cm (one of the sides of the parallelogram). Therefore, the area of each right triangle is (1/2) * 7 cm * 10 cm = 35 cm². The area of the parallelogram is then twice the area of one triangle, which is 2 * 35 cm² = 70 cm²."

      ],
      "explanation": "On a clock face, the hour hand moves 30° every hour. Since it's 15 minutes past 5, the hour hand has moved 1/4 of the way between 5 and 6 o'clock, which is 30° / 4 = 7.5°. The minute hand moves 360° every hour, so it moves 360° / 12 = 30° every 15 minutes. In this case, the minute hand has moved 45° (30° + 15°). To find the angle between the hands, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle, which gives us 45° - 7.5° = 37.5°. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 60°."
